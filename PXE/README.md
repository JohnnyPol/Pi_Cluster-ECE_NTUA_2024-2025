# Network (PXE) Boot
## Intuition and Necessity
Via PXE Boot Raspberry Pi devices are allowed to boot through network with no SD card required. A central Ubuntu server provides boot files via **TFTP** and the root filesystem via **NFS** enabling easy provisioning and centralized maintenance for many Pis. Furthermore, it offers a single source of truth, denoting that if an update occurs on rootfs of the server all devices can inherit the change in the next booting. On the other hand, it eases the process of adding new devices to the current cluster by creating per-device directories and a simple symlink. Normally, a device requests an IP address from a  DHCP server and via TFTP it downloads bootloader and kernel. Lastly, the kernel mounts its root filesystem over NFS. Especially for the Raspberry Pi, its firmware supports the above process natively and request boot file from the TFTP server(**start4.elf**,**kernel\*.img** and **cmdline.txt**) and afterwards it utilizes the information of **cmdline.txt** to mount the root filesystem from the NFS shared on the network.
## Prerequisites
Prior to setup, it is necessary to obtain the DHCP/TFTP and NFS-kernel server into the Ubuntu server and for each device the name/ID,MAC/Serial address should be known. Moreover, we will need a TFTP root directory on the ubuntu server and on each pi client one NFS directory along iwth a TFTP symlink named after the PI's serial pointing to that device's boot/ directory.
## Step-by-Step Setup
1. Use directory `/mnt/netboot2/nfs` as TFTP root directory. To do so we need to change the root TFTP directory(this stands for the directory from which the TFTP server serves files). For this, visit `/etc/default/tftp-hpa` file and change the TFTP_DIRECTORY to the desired. For our cluster:
```bash
TFTP_DIRECTORY="/mnt/netboot2/nfs"
```
When a Pi Client is requesting boot files during network boot, the tft-hpa will find them on the aforementioned directory.

2. Download Raspberry Pi OS Lite Image on Clients
```bash
cd /mnt/netboot2
wget -O raspios_lite_armhf_latest.img.xz https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_armhf_latest
unxz raspios_lite_armhf_latest.img.xz
```
For Ubuntu Server images, unzipping is not necessary since we typically get `.iso` files directly. 

3. Mount the boot and root partitions from the image
```bash
cd /mnt/netboot2
kpartx -a -v raspios_lite_armhf_latest.img
mkdir bootmnt
mkdir rootmnt
mount /dev/mapper/loop0p1 ./bootmnt/
mount /dev/mapper/loop0p2 ./rootmnt/
```
More specifically, `kpartx` command reads the partition table from the image provided and creates device files for the partitions in /dev/mapper. In our case it will create a `/dev/mapper/loop2p1` and `/dev/mapper/loop2p2` loop devices with the /boot and /partitions of the image, while bootmnt and rootmnt are just helper directories.

4. Suppose that our client machine is `red1`. Its serial number and MAC address are `bfb94a46` and `e4:5f:01:f6:07:87` respectively. So the next step is to export these variables inside `/mnt/netboot2` directory.
```bash
cd /mnt/netboot2
PI_SERIAL=bfb94a46
PI_MAC=e4:5f:01:f6:07:87
PI_NAME=red1
SERVER_IP=192.168.2.1
```
5. Copy the mounted Image
```bash
cd /mnt/netboot2
mkdir ./nfs/${PI_NAME}
cp -a ./rootmnt/* ./nfs/${PI_NAME}
cp -a ./bootmnt/* ./nfs/${PI_NAME}/boot
```
The second `cp` command will output an error for the `issue.txt` and `overlays`, which are for now broken symbolic links. To fix this, `cd ./nfs/${PI_NAME}/boot` and delete them and copy them again from the `/mnt/netboot2/bootmnt` directory. All in all:
```bash
cd /mnt/netboot2/nfs/${PI_NAME}/boot
rm issue.txt overlays
cp /mnt/netboot2/bootmnt/issue.txt .
cp -r /mnt/netboot2/bootmnt/overlays .
```
At this point inside `/mnt/netboot2` directory we can unmount `bootmnt` and `rootmnt`.

6. Edit the clientâ€™s `/etc/fstab` : On the client's image update `/etc/fstab` file so as to indicate how to initialize the filesystem during client's booting
```bash
vi /mnt/netboot2/nfs/${PI_NAME}/etc/fstab
#Add the line:
192.168.2.1:/mnt/netboot2/nfs/red1 /boot nfs defaults,vers=3 0 0
# Remember that "red1" is the PI_NAME in this example
```
7. Update `cmdline.txt` on client's image, a file which pass arguments to the Linux kernel. So, replace the current `cmdline.txt` in `/mnt/netboot2/nfs/${PI_NAME}/boot/` with the following:
```bash
 cat /mnt/netboot2/nfs/${PI_NAME}/boot/cmdline.txt
console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/nfs
nfsroot=192.168.2.1:/mnt/netboot2/nfs/red1,vers=3 rw ip=dhcp rootwait elevator=deadline
```
8. Update the `/` file *on the server*. This file contains an entry for each directory that can be exported to NFS clients. To do this, add the following:
```bash
$ vi /etc/exports
# Add the two following lines =>
/mnt/netboot2/nfs/red1 *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)
/mnt/netboot2/nfs/red1/boot *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)
```
9. Create a symbolic link in the tftp-root directory to `/boot` folder of the corresponding PI:
```bash
cd /mnt/netboot2/nfs # => This is the tftp-root directory
ln -s ${PI_NAME}/boot ${PI_SERIAL}
```
It is highlighted that tftp server searches by default in a directory named as the serial number for the configuration files of the corresponding client. 

10. Restart dhcp, tftp, and nfs server
```bash
# Restart DHCP server (if you're running isc-dhcp-server)
sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server

# Restart TFTP server
sudo systemctl restart tftpd-hpa

# Restart NFS server
sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server

# (Optional) Verify all services are active
sudo systemctl status isc-dhcp-server
sudo systemctl status tftpd-hpa
sudo systemctl status nfs-kernel-server
```

A summary of the components of this steups and their purposes can be seen below:

| **Component** | **Purpose** |
|----------------|-------------|
| **TFTP** | Transfers boot files like `start4.elf`, `cmdline.txt`, etc. |
| **NFS** | Mounts the root filesystem over the network. |
| **PXE/Netboot** | Booting over LAN without an SD card. |
| **Serial number (bfb94a46)** | Used to identify each Pi uniquely for TFTP. |
| **cmdline.txt** | Tells the kernel how to boot (e.g., use NFS). |
| **fstab** | Mounts `/boot` via NFS inside the running OS. |
| **DHCP** | Assigns IP and tells the Pi where to find the TFTP server. |
